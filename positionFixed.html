    <!The fourth type of positioning is fixed. This behaves similar to absolute positioning, but elements with fixed positioning are ALWAYS positioned relative to the active viewport. Now, what's that mean? If you position, for example, a fixed element with a top offset of 50 pixels and a right offset of 100 pixels, the top right corner of the element will be positioned 50 pixels over to the left and 100 pixels down. Unlike with absolute positioning, scrolling the page content would not affect this element's position at all. It will remain in that position, no matter how the screen was resized or scrolled. It truly is fixed.-->

<!In this example, notice that the red div is always in the bottom-left corner of the screen, no matter where on the page you scroll. If you change the style so that the red div has absolute positioning, you'll see the difference.-->
